The mung bean (Vigna radiata), alternatively known as the green gram, maash , or moong , is a plant species in the legume family. The mung bean is mainly cultivated in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.It is used as an ingredient in both savoury and sweet dishes.
The green gram is an annual vine with yellow flowers and fuzzy brown pods.
Mung beans are germinated by leaving them in water for four hours of daytime light and spending the rest of the day in the dark. Mung bean sprouts can be grown under artificial light for four hours over the period of a week. They are usually simply called "bean sprouts". However, when bean sprouts are called for in recipes, it generally refers to mung bean or soybean sprouts.
